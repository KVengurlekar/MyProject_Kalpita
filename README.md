Student Registration Form
Problem Statement: An organization needs to manage data related to candidates applying for a program. The
data includes many unique fields and details specific to each candidate. To streamline this process, we must
create a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) allowing users to input candidate data. The
application should validate data to ensure that all the entered information is relevant to the corresponding
fields. Once the user fills in the required data, the application should generate a PDF document containing all
the entered information for record-keeping and further processing.
Key Requirements:
1. Develop a GUt using Python's tkinter library to create an interactive interface for data input.
2.1mplement data validation mechanisms to ensure that each field contains valid and relevant data.
3. Provide error messages or notifications for invalid or missing data entries.
4. Generate a PDF document using the entered data and display a success message upon successful PDF
generation.
5. The PDF should include all the relevant details entered by the user, maintaining a structured format for easy
reference.
